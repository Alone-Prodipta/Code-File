		<h2 style="font-family:Merienda;">About Me</h2>
		<p>As a second-year college student, I am navigating life in India, discovering its unique culture and spirit through its colonies and narrow lanes.<br>
I believe that the lifestyle of India is hidden in these neighborhoods, each with its own sounds, faces, and stories waiting to be told.</p>

<p>I enjoy exploring the people around me — observing their facial expressions and features,<br>
which reflect their struggles and experiences.</p>

<p>For me, photography is not merely a profession but a way to freeze moments in time and capture the essence of life.<br>
I am drawn to those who try to express themselves through small gestures, celebrations, and everyday experiences.<br>
I especially enjoy photographing festivals and special events, where emotions and traditions come alive.</p>

<p>As a web developer, I view the world through logic and systems.<br>
This perspective has enriched my hobby, allowing me to capture and document people’s lives more thoughtfully.<br>
My sense of design — including graphic design and templates — reflects my personality and perspective.<br>
By applying principles such as color theory, I aim to create designs that resonate with both aesthetics and functionality.</p>

<p>Through my portfolio, I have combined my passion for photography with my profession in web development.<br>
I am deeply curious and always eager to learn new things.<br>
My character is shaped by a commitment to continuous growth and self-improvement.</p>
